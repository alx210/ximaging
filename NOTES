XImaging may be tweaked at compile time using following preprocessor switches:

ENABLE_NLS
	
	If defined, enables native language support. Since Ximaging doesn't 
	have any message catalogs other than US English yet, NLS is disabled
	by default, so this option is provided for localization and testing
	purposes.

NO_DEFAULT_WM_ICON
	
	Define to disable default (black and white) window shell icons.
	This allows for user defined pixmaps to be used for window manager
	icons.

RI_CHECK_FILE_MODTIME
	
	Define to enable file modification time checks.
	By default, only the directory modification time is checked at the
	specified refresh interval to determine if files were added, renamed
	or deleted. If desired, this switch may be used to enable file
	modification check so that edited images will be reloaded automatically.

SUNRAS_ALPHA

	If defined, the extra channel in Sun Raster images will be handled as
	an alpha (translucency) channel.
	The Sun Raster specification doesn't explicitly define the contents
	of the extra channel in 32 bit images, but some RAS writers use it for
	translucency. This option enables the handling of the extra channel as
	an alpha channel, but may result in pixel artifacts if the extra channel
	was used to store some obscure data.

BFILTER_OPT_MAX_SIZE <integer>
	
	Define the maximum number of pixels to include in a box filter when down
	-sampling images in the viewer (the browser is not affected). Larger
	values reduce performance hit, sacrificing image quality. This value
	must be larger than 2 to make sense. The default value is 4.
	If VIEWER_NO_BOX_FILTER_LIMIT is defined, this value has no effect.
	
VIEWER_NO_BOX_FILTER_LIMIT
	
	If defined, box filter quality limit in the viewer will be disabled.
	By default, if down-sampling filter is enabled, the viewer will limit
	the box filter quality in order to reduce performance hit (this doesn't
	affect the browser).
	
USE_XIMAGE_PIXFNC
	
	This instructs the XImaging blitter to use XLib's internal pixel reading
	and writing routines (which may be a way slower) rather that its own.
	Normally there is no reason to define this.

ENABLE_XINERAMA
	
	This is defined by default. Enables the use of the X Xinerama extension,
	if available.

ENABLE_JPEG/PNG/TIFF

	Build with 3rd party library bindings. These are defined by default.
