CDE/ToolTalk Integration
------------------------

XImaging must be built with CDE/ToolTalk support. A separate makefile
'Makefile.cde' is provided for this purpose. Change the working directory
to 'src' and run 'make -f Makefile.cde', then 'make -f Makefile.cde install'
as root.

For other ToolTalk aware applications, like Dtfile, to be able to communicate
with XImaging, the XImaging process type must be registered within the CDE ptype
database. Currently this must be done manually.

A Process Type script named XImaging.ptype is provided in the "share" directory.
To register it, run: tt_type_comp XImaging.ptype

The accompanying action and data type definition file named XImaging.dt, and
icons it refers to, must be installed into the "types" and "icons" directories:

	cp XImaging.dt ~/.dt/types
	cp XImaging.?.pm ~/.dt/icons

To add XImaging icon to the Application Manager, run:

	touch ~/.dt/appmanager/XImaging
	chmod +x ~/.dt/appmanager/XImaging

When done, tell CDE to reread the configuration by issuing:

	dtaction ReloadActions
	dtappgather

NOTES
-----

1.	If rpc.ttdbserver daemon is not running, tt_type_comp(1) will issue a
	TT_ERR_FILE warning, which can be ignored, but means that ttsession(1)
	needs to be manually notified about database changes. This is done by
	signaling it with SIGUSR2, or logging out and in again.

2.	The Process Type and data types may be installed system wide by running
	tt_type_comp as root, and copying the type definition and icon files to
	appropriate /etc/dt/appconfig sub-directories.
