1. PREREQUISITES
-----------------------------
Following libraries and headers are required:

libX11    (xorg including extensions)
libXm     (Motif)
libjpeg   (OpenJPEG)
libpng
libtiff

On most GNU/Linux distributions appropriate 'development' packages need to
be installed also - e.g. xorg-dev, motif-dev, etc.

2. BUILDING AND INSTALLING
-----------------------------
If necessary, tweak the target platform specific makefile, Makefile.$(uname),
in the mf sub-directory (to change the installation prefix, perhaps). If no
appropriate Makefile exists, try Makefile.generic.

Run 'make' in the top-level directory of the source distribution and follow
instructions. When build process finishes, run 'make install' as root.

3. NOTES
-----------------------------
OpenMP (multiprocessor optimizations) are enabled by default for Linux and
FreeBSD targets. This may cause the build to fail with OMP related errors
on architectures that don't support it. If this is the case, comment out
or delete the "ENABLE_OMP = 1" line in the platform specific makefile:
mf/Makefile.<platform name>
