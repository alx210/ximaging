1. PREREQUISITES
-----------------------------

C compiler and any SysV like Make.

Following libraries and headers are required by default:

libX11    (xorg including extensions)
libXm     (Motif)
libjpeg   (OpenJPEG)
libpng
libtiff

For configuration options and tweaks see comments in src/common.mf

On some GNU/Linux distributions appropriate 'development' packages need to
be installed also - e.g. xorg-dev, motif-dev, etc.

2. BUILDING AND INSTALLING
-----------------------------

To build and install using default configuration options, change the working
directory to 'src', run 'make', then 'make install' as root.

For information on building with CDE/ToolTalk support see the CDEINTEG file.

XImaging may be customized using X resources.  An example app-defaults file is
provided in share/XImaging.defaults. See ximaging(1) for more information.
