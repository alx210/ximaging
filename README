1. PREREQUISITES
-----------------------------
Following libraries and headers are required:

libX11    (xorg including extensions)
libXm     (Motif)
libjpeg   (OpenJPEG)
libpng
libtiff

On most GNU/Linux distributions appropriate 'development' packages need to
be installed also - e.g. xorg-dev, motif-dev, etc.

2. BUILDING AND INSTALLING
-----------------------------
If necessary, tweak the target platform specific makefile, Makefile.$(uname),
in the mf sub-directory (to change the installation prefix, perhaps). If no
appropriate Makefile exists, try Makefile.generic.

Run 'make' in the top-level directory of the source distribution and follow
instructions. When build process finishes, run 'make install' as root.
